    Welcome to the OUTSCALE API documentation.<br />
    The OUTSCALE API enables you to manage your resources in the OUTSCALE Cloud. This documentation describes the different actions available along with code examples.<br /><br />
    Throttling: To protect against overloads, the number of identical requests allowed in a given time period is limited.<br />
    Brute force: To protect against brute force attacks, the number of failed authentication attempts in a given time period is limited.<br /><br />
    Note that the OUTSCALE Cloud is compatible with Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, but there are [differences in resource names](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-the-APIs.html) between AWS and the OUTSCALE API.<br />
    You can also manage your resources using the [Cockpit](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Cockpit.html) web interface.<br /><br />
    An OpenAPI description of this API is also available for download: <button>[GitHub repository](https://github.com/outscale/osc-api)</button><br />
    # Authentication Schemes
    ### Access Key/Secret Key
    The main way to authenticate your requests to the OUTSCALE API is to use an access key and a secret key.<br />
    The mechanism behind this is based on AWS Signature Version 4, whose technical implementation details are described in [Signature of API Requests](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Signature-of-API-Requests.html).<br /><br />
    In practice, the way to specify your access key and secret key depends on the tool or SDK you want to use to interact with the API.<br />

    > For example, if you use OSC CLI:
    > 1. You need to create an **~/.osc/config.json** file to specify your access key, secret key, and the Region of your account.
    > 2. You then specify the `--profile` option when executing OSC CLI commands.
    >
    > For more information, see [Installing and Configuring OSC CLI](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Installing-and-Configuring-OSC-CLI.html).

    See the code samples in each section of this documentation for specific examples in different programming languages.<br />
    For more information about access keys, see [About Access Keys](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Access-Keys.html).

    > If you try to sign requests with an invalid access key four times in a row, further authentication attempts will be prevented for 1 minute. This lockout time increases 1 minute every four failed attempts, for up to 10 minutes.

    ### Login/Password
    For certain API actions, you can also use basic authentication with the login (email address) and password of your TINA account.<br />
    This is useful only in special circumstances, for example if you do not know your access key/secret key and want to retrieve them programmatically.<br />
    In most cases, however, you can use the Cockpit web interface to retrieve them.<br />

    > For example, if you use OSC CLI:
    > 1. You need to create an **~/.osc/config.json** file to specify the Region of your account, but you leave the access key value and secret key value empty (`&quot;&quot;`).
    > 2. You then specify the `--profile`, `--authentication-method`, `--login`, and `--password` options when executing OSC CLI commands.

    See the code samples in each section of this documentation for specific examples in different programming languages.

    > If you try to sign requests with an invalid password four times in a row, further authentication attempts will be prevented for 1 minute. This lockout time increases 1 minute every four failed attempts, for up to 10 minutes.

    ### No Authentication
    A few API actions do not require any authentication. They are indicated as such in this documentation.<br />
    ### Other Security Mechanisms
    In parallel with the authentication schemes, you can add other security mechanisms to your OUTSCALE account, for example to restrict API requests by IP or other criteria.<br />
    For more information, see [Managing Your API Accesses](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Managing-Your-API-Accesses.html).

        * You need OUTSCALE credentials and the appropriate quotas to create an account via API. To get quotas, you can send an email to sales@outscale.com.<br />
        * If you want to pass a numeral value as a string instead of an integer, you must wrap your string in additional quotes (for example, `'&quot;92000&quot;'`).

  /CreateImage:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates an OUTSCALE machine image (OMI).<br />
        You can use this method for different use cases:
        * **Creating from a VM**: You create an OMI from one of your virtual machines (VMs).<br>
        * **Copying an OMI**: You copy an existing OMI. The source OMI can be one of your own OMIs, or an OMI owned by another account that has granted you permission via the [UpdateImage](#updateimage) method.<br>
        * **Registering from a snapshot**: You register an OMI from an existing snapshot. The source snapshot can be one of your own snapshots, or a snapshot owned by another account that has granted you permission via the [UpdateSnapshot](#updatesnapshot) method.<br>
        * **Registering from a bucket by using a manifest file**: You register an OMI from the manifest file of an OMI that was exported to an OUTSCALE Object Storage (OOS) bucket. First, the owner of the source OMI must export it to the bucket by using the [CreateImageExportTask](#createimageexporttask) method. Then, they must grant you permission to read the manifest file via a pre-signed URL. For more information, see [Creating a Pre-Signed URL](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Creating-a-Pre-Signed-URL.html).

        **[TIP]**<br />
        Registering from a bucket enables you to copy an OMI across Regions.

        For more information, see [About OMIs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-OMIs.html).

        You cannot export a shared or public OMI, as they do not belong to you. To do so, you must first copy it to your account. The copy then belongs to you and you can export it.<br /><br />
        For more information, see [About OMIs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-OMIs.html).

  /CreateKeypair:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a keypair to use with your virtual machines (VMs).<br />
        You can use this method in two different ways:
        * **Creating a keypair**: In that case, 3DS OUTSCALE creates a 2048-bit RSA keypair, stores its public key in your account, and returns its private key in the response of the call so that you can save it in a file.<br />
        When you save the returned private key, make sure you replace the `\n` escape sequences with real line breaks.
        * **Importing a keypair created locally**: If you already have a keypair that you have created locally with a third-party tool, you can import its public key in your account. The following types of key can be imported: RSA (2048 bits or preferably 4096 bits), Ed25519, and ECDSA (256 bits, 384 bits, or 521 bits). The following formats can be used: PEM, PKCS8, RFC4716, and OpenSSH.

  /CreateLoadBalancerPolicy:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes defined by the browser lifetime.<br />
        The created policy can be used with HTTP or HTTPS listeners only.<br />
        If this policy is implemented by a load balancer, this load balancer uses this cookie in all incoming requests to direct them to the specified backend server virtual machine (VM). If this cookie is not present, the load balancer sends the request to any other server according to its load-balancing algorithm.<br /><br />

        You can also create a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes following the lifetime of an application-generated cookie.<br />
        Unlike the other type of stickiness policy, the lifetime of the special Load Balancer Unit (LBU) cookie follows the lifetime of the application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The load balancer inserts a new stickiness cookie only when the application response includes a new application cookie.<br />
        The session stops being sticky if the application cookie is removed or expires, until a new application cookie is issued.<br /><br />

  /CreateNatService:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a network address translation (NAT) service in the specified public Subnet of a Net.<br />
        A NAT service enables virtual machines (VMs) placed in the private Subnet of this Net to connect to the Internet, without being accessible from the Internet.<br />
        When creating a NAT service, you specify the allocation ID of the public IP you want to use as public IP for the NAT service. Once the NAT service is created, you need to create a route in the route table of the private Subnet, with 0.0.0.0/0 as destination and the ID of the NAT service as target. For more information, see [LinkPublicIP](#linkpublicip) and [CreateRoute](#createroute).<br />
        This action also enables you to create multiple NAT services in the same Net (one per public Subnet).<br /><br />

        **[IMPORTANT]**<br />
        You cannot modify the public IP associated with a NAT service after its creation. To do so, you need to delete the NAT service and create a new one with another public IP.<br /><br />

  /CreateNetAccessPoint:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a Net access point to access an OUTSCALE service from this Net without using the Internet and public IPs.<br />
        You specify the service using its name. For more information about the available services, see [ReadNetAccessPointServices](#readnetaccesspointservices).<br /> <br />
        To control the routing of traffic between the Net and the specified service, you can specify one or more route tables. Virtual machines placed in Subnets associated with the specified route table thus use the Net access point to access the service. When you specify a route table, a route is automatically added to it with the destination set to the prefix list ID of the service, and the target set to the ID of the access point.<br /><br />
        When a Net access point is created, a public IP is automatically allocated to your account and used for the Net access point. This public IP is not connected to the Internet. It is counted in your quota, but it is not billed.<br /> <br />

        Requests a Net peering between a Net you own and a peer Net that belongs to you or another account.<br />
        This action creates a Net peering that remains in the `pending-acceptance` state until it is accepted by the owner of the peer Net. If the owner of the peer Net does not accept the request within 7 days, the state of the Net peering becomes `expired`. For more information, see [AcceptNetPeering](#acceptnetpeering).<br /><br />

        **[IMPORTANT]**<br />
        * The two Nets must not have overlapping IP ranges. Otherwise, the Net peering is in the `failed` state.<br />
        * A peering connection between two Nets works both ways. If an A-to-B connection is already created and accepted, creating a B-to-A connection is not necessary and would be automatically rejected.

        Creates a security group.<br />
        This action creates a security group either in the public Cloud or in a specified Net. By default, a default security group for use in the public Cloud and a default security group for use in a Net are created.<br />
        When launching a virtual machine (VM), if no security group is explicitly specified, the appropriate default security group is assigned to the VM. Default security groups include a default rule granting VMs network access to each other.<br />
        When creating a security group, you specify a name. Two security groups for use in the public Cloud or for use in a Net cannot have the same name.<br />
        You can have up to 500 security groups in the public Cloud. You can create up to 500 security groups per Net.<br />
        To add or remove rules, use the [CreateSecurityGroupRule](#createsecuritygrouprule) method.<br /><br />
        For more information, see [About Security Groups](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Security-Groups.html).

  /CreateSecurityGroupRule:
    post:
      description: |-
        Adds one or more rules to a security group.<br />
        Use the `SecurityGroupId` parameter to specify the security group for which you want to create a rule.<br />
        Use the `Flow` parameter to specify if you want an inbound rule or an outbound rule.<br /><br />
        An inbound rule allows the security group to receive traffic:
        * Either from a specific IP range (`IpRange` parameter) on a specific port range (`FromPortRange` and `ToPortRange` parameters) and specific protocol (`IpProtocol` parameter).
        * Or from another specific security group (`SecurityGroupAccountIdToLink` and `SecurityGroupNameToLink` parameters).<br />

        (Net only) An outbound rule works similarly but allows the security group to send traffic rather than receive traffic.<br />

        Alternatively, you can use the `Rules` parameter to add several rules at the same time. Note that the `SecurityGroupName` subparameter can only be used for security groups in the public Cloud.

        **[NOTE]**<br />
        * The modifications are effective as quickly as possible, but a small delay may occur.<br />
        * By default, traffic between two security groups is allowed through both public and private IPs. To restrict traffic to private IPs only, contact our Support team at support@outscale.com.

        Creates a server certificate and its matching private key.<br /><br />
        These elements can be used with other services (for example, to configure SSL termination on load balancers).<br /><br />
        You can also specify the chain of intermediate certification authorities if your certificate is not directly signed by a root one. You can specify multiple intermediate certification authorities in the `CertificateChain` parameter. To do so, concatenate all certificates in the correct order (the first certificate must be the authority of your certificate, the second must be the authority of the first one, and so on).<br /><br />
        The private key must be a RSA key in PKCS1 form. To check this, open the PEM file and ensure its header reads as follows: BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY.<br /><br />
        [IMPORTANT]<br /><br />
        This private key must not be protected by a password or a passphrase.<br /><br />

  /CreateSnapshot:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a snapshot. Snapshots are point-in-time images of a volume that you can use to back up your data or to create replicas of this volume.<br />
        You can use this method in three different ways:
        * **Creating from a volume**: You create a snapshot from one of your volumes.<br />
        * **Copying a snapshot**: You copy an existing snapshot. The source snapshot can be one of your own snapshots, or a snapshot owned by another account that has granted you permission via the [UpdateSnapshot](#updatesnapshot) method.<br />
        * **Importing from a bucket**: You import a snapshot located in an OUTSCALE Object Storage (OOS) bucket. First, the owner of the source snapshot must export it to a bucket by using the [CreateSnapshotExportTask](#createsnapshotexporttask) method. Then, they must grant you permission to read the snapshot via a pre-signed URL. For more information, see [Creating a Pre-Signed URL](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Creating-a-Pre-Signed-URL.html).

        **[NOTE]**<br />
        In case of excessive use of the snapshot creation feature on the same volume over a short period of time, 3DS OUTSCALE reserves the right to temporarily block the feature.

        Creates virtual machines (VMs), and then launches them.<br />
        This action enables you to create a specified number of VMs using an OUTSCALE machine image (OMI) that you are allowed to use, and then to automatically launch them.<br />
        The VMs remain in the `pending` state until they are created and ready to be used. Once automatically launched, they are in the `running` state.<br />
        To check the state of your VMs, call the [ReadVms](#readvms) method.<br />
        The metadata server enables you to get the public key provided when the VM is launched. Official OMIs contain a script to get this public key and put it inside the VM to provide secure access without password.<br />
        If not specified, the security group used by the service is the default one.<br />

        **[NOTE]**<br />
        When you attach a security group to a VM, it is actually attached to the primary network interface of the VM.<br />

        For more information, see [About VMs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VMs.html).

        For the rule to be deleted, the values specified in the deletion request must exactly match the value of the existing rule.<br />
        In case of TCP and UDP protocols, you have to indicate the destination port or range of ports. In case of ICMP protocol, you have to specify the ICMP type and code numbers.<br />
        Rules (IP permissions) consist of the protocol, IP range or source security group.<br />
        To remove outbound access to a destination security group, we recommend to use a set of IP permissions. We also recommend to specify the protocol in a set of IP permissions.<br />

        Alternatively, you can use the `Rules` parameter to delete several rules at the same time.

        Attaches one of your allocated flexible GPUs (fGPUs) to one of your virtual machines (VMs).<br />
        To complete the linking of the fGPU, you need to do a stop/start of the VM. A simple restart is not sufficient, as the linking of the fGPU is done when the VM goes through the `stopped` state. For the difference between stop/start and restart, see [About VM Lifecycle](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VM-Lifecycle.html).<br /><br />

        You can attach fGPUs only to VMs with the `highest` (1) performance flag. For more information see [About Flexible GPUs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Flexible-GPUs.html) and [VM Types](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/VM-Types.html).

        If you provide one or more VM IDs, this action returns a description for all of these VMs. If you do not provide any VM ID, this action returns a description for all of the VMs that belong to you. If you provide an invalid VM ID, an error is returned. If you provide the ID of a VM that does not belong to you, the description of this VM is not included in the response. The refresh interval for data returned by this action is one hour, meaning that a terminated VM may appear in the response.

        The VMs can be in different Subnets and different Subregions than the load balancer, as long as the VMs and load balancers are all in the public Cloud or all in the same Net. It may take a little time for a VM to be registered with the load balancer.

        Modifies the specified attributes of a virtual machine (VM).<br />
        You must stop the VM before modifying the following attributes:<br />
        * `NestedVirtualization`<br />
        * `Performance`<br />
        * `UserData`<br />
        * `VmType`

        To complete the update of secure boot, you need to do a stop/start of the VM. A simple restart is not sufficient, as the update is done when the VM goes through the stopped state. For the difference between stop/start and restart, see [About VM Lifecycle](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VM-Lifecycle.html).

        **[WARNING]**<br />
        - We recommend creating a snapshot of your volume before updating it, in case any issue occurs during the process. For more information, see [Creating a Snapshot of a Volume](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Creating-a-Snapshot-of-a-Volume.html).
        - Do not shut down or restart the virtual machine (VM) from within the guest operating system while a volume update is in progress. This interrupts the process and compromises the integrity of the volume.
        - When the modification is not instantaneous, the response displays the previous value. You can use the [ReadVolumeUpdateTasks](#readvolumeupdatetasks) method to see the progression of the update.<br />
