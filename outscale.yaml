    description: 'Creates an OUTSCALE machine image (OMI) from an existing virtual machine (VM) which is either running or stopped.<br />

      This action also creates a snapshot of the root volume of the VM, as well as a snapshot of each Block Storage Unit (BSU) volume attached to the VM. For more information, see [About OMIs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-OMIs.html).<br /><br />


      You can also use this method to copy an OMI to your account, from an account in the same Region. To do so, the owner of the source OMI must share it with your account. For more information about how to share an OMI with another account in the same Region, see [UpdateImage](#updateimage).<br />

      To copy an OMI between accounts in different Regions, the owner of the source OMI must first export it to an OUTSCALE Object Storage (OOS) bucket using the [CreateImageExportTask](#createimageexporttask) method, and then you need to create a copy of the image in your account.<br />

      The copy of the source OMI is independent and belongs to you.<br /><br />


      You can also use this method to register an OMI to finalize its creation process.<br />

      You can register an OMI from a snapshot of a root device to create an OMI based on this snapshot. You can also register an OMI that has been exported to an S3-compatible bucket to create a copy of it in your account. For more information about OMI export to an OOS bucket, see [CreateImageExportTask](#createimageexporttask).<br />

      You can register an OMI using a pre-signed URL of the manifest file of the OMI. You do not need any permission for this OMI, or the bucket in which it is contained. The manifest file is obsolete seven days after a completed export as it contains pre-signed URLs to the appropriate snapshots (pre-signed URLs are valid for only seven days).<br />

      Once the OMI is registered, you can launch a VM from this OMI. The copy of the source OMI is independent and belongs to you.'

      The VMs can be in different Subnets and different Subregions than the load balancer, as long as the VMs and load balancers are all in the public Cloud or all in the same Net.
